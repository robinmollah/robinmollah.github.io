We give very little to no attention to increasing the lifespan of our software source code. The less attention we give 
to this, the faster we will make our system a legacy system.



To avoid creating a legacy system, here are some points we can consider:



Predict the lifespans of the tech stack: We should keep an eye on the life span of programming language, libraries, 
frameworks, cloud providers, third-party vendors, and open-source projects as well. Suppose, your project highly depends on AWS for storage. If AWS fails to cope with improved storage solutions then part of your system is also failing. If any open-source projects cannot move without contribution



Let's consider the case of Android development.

The way we develop Android apps today is very different from the way we have done only 6-8 years back. Eclipse was the leading IDE, Now Android Studio. We used ADT Bundle instead of Android SDK. There is a huge improvement brought in development, data structure, security, UI, etc.



If a codebase was reluctant to step back from adopting new changes, it's now become a legacy system.
