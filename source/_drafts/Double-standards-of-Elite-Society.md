এই আর্টিকেলে আমি বলবো কেন অপু ভাই এবং হিরো আলমরা আমাদের দেশে
Educated peoples reaction when someone possesses ice, LSD, yaba, vandalize private properties, makes false accuse of rape, and so on:

It's her personal choice. It is her life, let her deal with it. It is none of your business.

The same educated people when an underprivileged guy from Bogra making films with limited resources, education, and experience, putting honest effort, feeding his family:

Hero Alom is destroying the cinema industry and the image of Bangladesh.

My failed education cannot answer why Hero Alom, Opu Bhai, and all these underprivileged communities cannot make a choice to make films? What law prevents them to do that? Why it should be prevented?
